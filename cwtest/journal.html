  <p>
	well I made it 1200 miles already, and I passed through some interesting places on the way:
  </p>
  <ol>  
	<li>walla walla, WA</li>
        <li>Magic city,  ID</li>
        <li>Bountiful,uT</li>
	<li>Last chance,co</li>

	<li>Truth or consequences,NM</li>
  </ol>

	I saw some Burma Shave style signs on the side of the road today:
  </p>
  <blockquote>
	passing cars,<br>
   	when you can't ss,<br> 
	may get you,<br> 
	A glimpse,<br> 
	of etenuity.<br>
  </blockquote>
  <p> 
  	I definitely won't be passing any cars!
  </p>

  <p>
	My first day of the trip!I can't believe finally got everything packed and ready to go.Because I'm on a 	segway,I wasn't able to bring a whole lot with me:
  </p>
  <ul>
	<li>cell phone</li>
	<li>ipod</li>
        <li>digital camera</li> 
	<li>and a protein bar</li>
  </ul>
  <p>
	Just the essentials. As Lao TZu would have said,<q>A journey of a thousand miles begins with one segway</q>¡£
